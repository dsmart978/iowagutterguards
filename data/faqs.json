    "question": "Do gutter guards actually work in Iowa?",
    "answer": "Yes, if you choose the right type. In Iowa, the main issues are spring seed pods, summer storms, and fall leaves, plus snow and ice in winter. A properly installed micro-mesh style guard is designed to block debris while still letting water in during heavy rain."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of gutter guard do you install?",
    "answer": "We install a premium micro-mesh system. It’s built to stop common debris like leaves, pine needles, and shingle grit while still handling high water volume during storms."
  },
  {
    "question": "Will gutter guards stop all gutter cleaning forever?",
    "answer": "They dramatically reduce clogs, but nothing is truly “never.” Most homes only need an occasional check for roof debris or valleys dumping material. The goal is to eliminate the recurring clog-and-overflow cycle."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you install gutter guards on existing gutters?",
    "answer": "Usually, yes. We check the gutter condition, pitch, attachment points, and fascia. If the gutters are bent, sagging, or undersized for the roofline, we’ll recommend repairs or replacement first so the guards actually perform."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do gutter guards work in heavy rain and thunderstorms?",
    "answer": "They should, when correctly sized and installed. We confirm water flow, gutter pitch, and downspout capacity. Most overflow problems come from undersized gutters, bad pitch, or clogged/downspouts, not the guard itself."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do gutter guards cause ice dams or make winter problems worse?",
    "answer": "Gutter guards don’t create ice dams. Ice dams are primarily an attic insulation/ventilation issue. Guards can help keep gutters from filling with wet debris that freezes. If your home needs heat cable, we’ll tell you directly."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you install heat cable with gutter guards?",
    "answer": "Yes, depending on the roof edge and gutter setup. If heat cable is needed, we’ll recommend a configuration that keeps the melt path open without fighting the guard system."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much do gutter guards cost?",
    "answer": "Pricing depends on linear footage, gutter height, roof complexity, and whether repairs are needed. We’ll give you a fast quote and then confirm details before scheduling, so you’re not guessing."
  },
  {
    "question": "How long does installation take?",
    "answer": "Most installs are completed in a single visit. Timing depends on the home size, height, roofline complexity, and whether we’re doing repairs or adjustments before the guards go on."
  },
  {
    "question": "What’s included with your install?",
    "answer": "We inspect the existing system, secure and correct obvious issues (pitch/fastening concerns), install the guard system properly, and verify water flow. If your gutters are in rough shape, we’ll explain the fix before we install anything."
