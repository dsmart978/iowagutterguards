  <h2>What happens next</h2>
  <p>Thanks for reaching out. Your message was received and we will follow up as soon as possible. If you requested gutter guard installation, heat cable, gutter replacement, gutter repair, or cleaning, we may ask one or two quick questions so we can give you an accurate recommendation. Helpful details include your city, the age of the gutters (if you know it), and what problem you want solved such as overflowing, dripping seams, downspout issues, or winter ice buildup.</p>
  <p>If you want to speed things up, you can reply with photos of the front of the home and any problem areas. We use that to confirm what materials and roofline sections are involved, and whether the best solution is guards, a repair, or a full replacement. Either way, we will keep it straightforward and focused on stopping water damage and preventing repeat issues.</p>

  <h2>What happens next</h2>
  <p>We review your request and follow up to confirm a few details like your address, the type of gutters you have, and any problem areas such as overflowing corners, ice dams, or heavy debris. If photos help, we will ask for them, but it is not required. Our goal is to get you a clear plan and a fair quote without wasting your time. If you need service sooner due to a leak or blockage, mention it and we will prioritize accordingly.</p>
