  <h2>What happens next</h2>
  <p>Thanks for reaching out. Your message was received and we will follow up as soon as possible. If you requested gutter guard installation, heat cable, gutter replacement, gutter repair, or cleaning, we may ask one or two quick questions so we can give you an accurate recommendation. Helpful details include your city, the age of the gutters (if you know it), and what problem you want solved such as overflowing, dripping seams, downspout issues, or winter ice buildup.</p>
  <p>If you want to speed things up, you can reply with photos of the front of the home and any problem areas. We use that to confirm what materials and roofline sections are involved, and whether the best solution is guards, a repair, or a full replacement. Either way, we will keep it straightforward and focused on stopping water damage and preventing repeat issues.</p>
