# Analytics Guide for Iowa Gutter Guards

**The Bottom Line:** Google Analytics does NOT help your Google rankings. It's just a way to see what's happening on your website.

## Do You Even Need Analytics?

### If You Just Care About "Does the Phone Ring?"

You might not need any website analytics. Here's what actually matters:

1. **Phone calls** → You already know when it rings
2. **Form submissions** → You get an email when someone submits
3. **Google ranking** → Check by searching "gutter guards [your city]"

Analytics is extra insight, not a requirement.

## What Google Analytics CAN Tell You

| Insight | Example | Useful? |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Which cities bring visitors | "50 people from Ankeny visited this month" | Maybe |
| Which pages people look at | "The Pella page gets more traffic than Des Moines" | Useful |
| How people found you | "40% from Google, 30% direct, 20% Facebook" | Useful |
| Phone link clicks | "15 people clicked to call this week" | Useful |
| Where people leave | "Most people leave after FAQ section" | Maybe |

---

## What Google Analytics CANNOT Tell You

- **Did they actually call?** (click ≠ call)
- **Did they book a job?** (you know this from your calendar)
- **Which specific ad made them call?** (need CallRail for this)

## Google Analytics vs. Call Tracking

| | Google Analytics | Call Tracking (CallRail) |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | Free | ~$45/month |
| **Tracks** | Website behavior | Actual phone calls |
| **Shows** | "Someone clicked phone number" | "John called from Google Ad, talked 3 min" |
| **Good for** | General website insights | Knowing which marketing generates calls |
| **Setup** | Add code to website | Swap phone numbers |

## My Recommendation

### If You're NOT Running Paid Ads
Skip analytics for now. Just focus on:
- Making sure your phone works
- Responding to form submissions quickly  
- Checking Google rankings monthly

### If You ARE Running Paid Ads (Google Ads, Facebook, etc.)
Get CallRail (~$45/month). It tells you exactly which ads make the phone ring. This is way more valuable than GA4 for a service business.

### If You Want Free Basic Tracking
Enable GA4 (instructions in README.md). You'll see:
- How many people visit
- Which pages they look at
- How many click your phone number

---

## Quick Setup (If You Want GA4)

1. Go to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)
2. Create account → Create property → Web
3. Get your Measurement ID (looks like `G-ABC123XYZ`)
4. In your website files, uncomment the GA4 code and replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your ID

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Does GA4 help SEO? | **No** |
| Is GA4 required? | **No** |
| Will it make phone ring more? | **No** |
| Is it useful? | **Maybe** – depends on if you'll actually look at reports |
| What DOES make phones ring? | Good SEO, good reviews, professional website (which you have) |
